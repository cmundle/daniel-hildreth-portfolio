###### Taylor Burke

Taylor's sense of adventure and genuine aspiration of life gives me life. I'm always curious to see where he is off to next, the next location, the next adventure. It has been fun to watch his following grow my 10's of thousands to 100's of thousands. Taylor also has a hilarious sense of humour, his Snap Chat stories while on the road and in between shots are not one to be missed. Make sure to follow him on Instagram [@taylormichaelburk](https://www.instagram.com/taylormichaelburk/) and on Snapchat username is: taylorburk1991 and his [portfolio](http://www.taylorburk.com).

###### Hello Mr. Magazine

I enjoy a good magazine, it was hard to narrow done a favourite one but after looking back at it Hello Mr. is a good choice. Providing their readers with an insight on gay culture, fashion, writing and pop culture, Hello Mr. does it beautifully. Their Spotify monthly playlists are always something I look forward to, as well as their reveal of their covers. Hello Mr. has one of my favourite deliveries of culture, they are quick, relevant and fun.

###### Ryan Putnam

Designer, Illustrator, Potter, Father is his bio and he completes all in some magical way. Besides that, Ryan has an incredible style of illustration. His portraits are what I look forward to seeing most, just as much as his landscapes and iconography. Looking at his overall feed, I think it helps him greatly that he is using a consistent colour to unify and connect. If his style was not enough to be stand out, which I think it does, the colour and standard texture pattern within his illustration boosts his aesthetic.

###### Worker Bee Supply Co.

One of my favourite most recent finds. I had originally came across one of the founders while working at Chatelaine as I wanted to use one of her photos for the magazine, we've been following each other since and this new venture is a great one! Fair priced prints are hard to come by, especially one of a kind from talented artists - these guys are on the right track. Love what they stand for and how they are doing it.

###### Patrick Janelle

Patrick Janelle otherwise known as "aguynamedpatrick" was the first person I thought of when writing this post. His travelling, events, fashion and food create a great mix for a perfect feed. His food shots make me want to eat the fish, visit the restaurant (visited a couple of his spots while in LA & SF) his fashion posts make me wish I had his clothes or sense of style and his travel shots.. everybody wishes for an escape to unknown territory. If you don't already follow him make sure you at least go check him out.
