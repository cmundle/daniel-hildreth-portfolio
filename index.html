      <h2>Hi I’m Daniel. I am a Torontonian, a lover of colour, food and cats.</h2>

        <p>I’m also a designer currently helping Agency Dominion make beautiful
          & performance driven websites. I enjoy working on all the elements of
          website design, from desktop to mobile - especially mobile. I’m best
          at being open minded about all possibilities, pixel perfect on my
          designs and to figure out direct solutions for all problems that life
          throws.</p>
        <p>I work with global brands and local businesses everyday on numerous
          websites. I’m always ready to help small businesses, or large, who
          are interested in growing their online presence and brand. Want to
          work together? Or have some questions for me? Want to learn more about me?</p>
