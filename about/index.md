I enjoy working on all elements of website design, from desktop to mobile -
especially mobile, and everything else. I'm best at being open minded about all
possibilities, paying attention to every pixel and figuring out direct solutions
for all problems that life throws. Currently working with global brands and
local businesses everyday on numerous websites but when I’m not designing and
clicking away the day, you can find me snuggling with my cat or binging on the
latest Netflix Original, or quite possibly both!

If you want to work together or have any additional questions for me, I’d love
to hear from you and to talk all things design.
