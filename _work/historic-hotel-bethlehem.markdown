I believe this site to be very functional, pretty, light, and upscale. The concept
was based on the "experience" of staying in a Historic Hotel of America: the grandness
of the event spaces and importance of local history.

Sometimes beauty and functionality can be sitting at two different sides of
the table, however I feel there is always a middle. For this site there
was both compromises and gains. I'm proud of the typography work, small details
and new achievements accomplished on this site, which have led to improve many
other sites that Agency Dominion has completed since.
