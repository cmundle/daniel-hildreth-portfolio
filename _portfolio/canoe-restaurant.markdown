"Canoe is critically acclaimed to be one of Canada's best restaurants" No pressure
guys. I've yet to eat at Canoe, I've dined at most of the other O&B restaurants
and know for a fact that when something is said they do a good job of living up
to it. The O&B Team wanted our concept for Canoe to be simple, not over the top
like the previously designed sites for them. They loved the idea of shifting the
focus to photography and big type. To achieve this; respective image heights for
different screen sizes, big type with large white space surround and a non cluttered
approach to the overall design were utilized. Being a seasonal and Canadian focused
menu means a lot of change and turn around, menus are constantly updated as well
as imagery and ideas. We focused on an ease to change the look and feel and making
it easy for the O&B Team to do this themselves. Some very refined design and user
experience choices were implemented specifically for  mobile and all the O&B sites.
One being the locked quick action bar including the commonly used actions while
browsing on a phone, a scroll to top arrow and the quick navigation above the footer
on all pages. I'm proud of this design for Canoe and all designs for Oliver and
Bonacini done by our team at AD. I can't wait to celebrate a special occasion
and to dine at Canoe with those panoramic city views.
