I am a Torontonian, cat lover, and a designer currently helping Agency Dominion
make beautiful & performance driven websites. I enjoy working on all the elements
of website design, from desktop to mobile - especially mobile. I love the hustle
and bustle that Toronto has, and I also enjoy spending time in the quietest places
in Canada. Nothing is more relaxing to be than being lake side at my cottage
listening to nature and watching the clouds. I love to travel and to see different
cultures than my own, new cities and the adventures that they bring.

I’m best at being open minded about all possibilities, pixel perfect on my designs
and to figure out direct solutions for all problems that life throws. I’m always
ready to help small businesses, or large, who are interested in growing their
online presence and brand. I work with global brands and local businesses
everyday on numerous websites, all while managing client communication for
Beam Local. When I’m not designing and clicking away the day, you can find me
snuggling with my cat or binging on the latest Netflix Original, or quite possibly
both!

Want to work together? Or have some questions for me? Did you like a portfolio
piece of mine and want to know more about it? I’d love to hear from you and to
talk all things design, must see travel locations & TIFF movies. You can find
me online (almost everywhere) using @danielhildreth, or you can email me direct here.
