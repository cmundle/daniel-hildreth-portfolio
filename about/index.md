I’m an experienced team leader and thrive collaborating with multi-disciplinary groups to solve complex problems and create intuitive experiences.

My skills include product design, interactive design, aesthetic art direction, prototyping, mobile design, branding, front-end development and team leadership. I’m interested in clean aesthetics, minimalism, unusual typography, photography and simplistic UX solutions.

Previously at Agency Dominion and Concrete Design, now working at AZURE Magazine on a range of projects including digital campaigns, print layouts, email marketing, e-commerce solutions, marketing sites, interactive installations and brand development.

I’m always looking to collaborate on interesting projects with awesome people. Need a hand? I have two – email me.
