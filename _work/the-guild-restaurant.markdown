Hot of the press, or in this case, butcher block. Agency Dominion is proud to have
just launched Oliver & Bonacini's latest Restaurant Website, The Guild Calgary.
I was lucky enough to have been the design lead on this project but could not have
completed it without the rest of the team. This design pushed me into a new world of
heavy and dark ideas, from using skulls (which I never thought I'd do) to using
mainly black & white photography. The parallax scrolling of textures is also a
nice-to-have bonus on this website.
