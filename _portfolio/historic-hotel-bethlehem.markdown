The site for Hotel Bethlehem was a lengthy back and forth process of us fighting
for what we believed in and the management fighting for what they wanted. In the
end the client supplied their must haves and we let them have them.
Other than those sacrifices, I believe this site to be very functional, pretty,
light, and upscale. The concept was based on the "experience" of staying in a
Historic Hotel of America: the grandness of the large event spaces and importance
of local history. One of most memorable things I got to do during this project was
looking back through their photo archives and seeing images from the early 1900's
to now: seeing the change, people, events, rooms and past decor. It was fun.

Sometimes beauty and functionality can be sitting at two different sides of
the table, however I feel there is always a middle. For this site there
was both compromises and gains. I'm proud of the typography work, small details
and new achievements accomplished on this site, which have led to improve many
others that have followed.
