Taking a company which you work for and redesigning their website in it's entirety,
as well as leveling up it's branding to be more focused and mature, was actually
easier than I thought it would be. By simplifying brand elements, colours and
fonts, a new Beam Local emerged. The new website has continually improved since
the initial launch of it's single page: it now has fresh new blog posts every week
and slight enhancements over time.

I am proud to work at Beam Local and to be part of the team that helped this
project come together, especially when this website is at the foreground
representing us and all that we do.
