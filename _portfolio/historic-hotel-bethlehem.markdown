The site for Hotel Bethlehem was a lengthy back and forth process, of us fighting
for what we believed in and the management fighting for what they wanted. In the
end the client supplied their must haves and we let them have what they wanted.
Other than those sacrifices I believe this site to be very functional, pretty,
light, and upscale. The concept was based on the "experience" of staying in a
Historic Hotel of America, the grandness, large event spaces and importance of
local history over the years. One of my favourites things I got to do during
this project was looking back through their photo archives and seeing images
from the early 1900's to now, seeing the change, the people, events, rooms and
decor. It was fun. I understand that beauty and functionality are normally two
different sides of the table but there is always a middle ground. For this site
there were sacrifices and gains, I'm proud of the typography work, small details
and new achievements accomplished on this site which have since helped improve
many others.
