When Agency Dominion was supplied with the initial brand vision from the O&B Team there was
a lot to accomplish and live up to in a design for the first restaurant to open
in Toronto's financial district. I loved the honesty, the rich food photography
and the hint of New York City and I was immediately envisioning sophistication, bold energy,
cocktails and business with a rough edge.

Bringing the concept together for Jump went through a few processes and a couple
additional concepts. In the end it was a mesh of two ideas, combined in one.
Being the design lead on this project showed me the complexities of the process
and how all my research about restaurant websites paid off. The process went
great: being in charge of content, building, QA and working with the client on
changes/updates was a fun progression.
