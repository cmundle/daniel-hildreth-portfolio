I wish, plan and hope for the day that I can stay at The Spectator Hotel. This
website started from a previous landing page of sorts when the hotel was still
in development and being built. It featured artist renderings and minimum amount
of copy. Once the hotel officially opened, I was given the task of designing a
fully functional, photo heavy website for this brand new hotel. The Hotel owner
was also the interior designer of the hotel and her main goal was to showcase
the level of luxury and simplicity the hotel offers, all while generating bookings
of course!
