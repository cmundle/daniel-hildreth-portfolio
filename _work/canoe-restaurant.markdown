I have yet to eat at Canoe: I've dined at most of the other O&B restaurants
and know for a fact that when something is said, they do a good job of living up
to their word. The O&B Team wanted our concept for Canoe to be simple and clean,
they loved the idea of putting the focus on photography and big type. To achieve this we
utilized a non-cluttered approach to the overall design and applied respective image
heights for different screen sizes. The whole team at Agency Dominion really came
together to make this site as great as it is.

I cannot wait to celebrate a special occasion at Canoe with their signature
panoramic city views!
