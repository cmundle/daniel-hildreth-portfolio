When we were supplied with the initial brand vision from the O&B Team there was
a lot to accomplish and live up too in a design for the first restaurant to open
in the financial district (say what!?). "Jump has since continued to define
downtown dining. The food is robust and honest, featuring North American cuisine
with an influence of the beloved New York City." With that teaser in mind,
what do you take from it? I close my eyes and envision sophistication, business,
energy, bold, cocktails and a rough edgy side. Bringing a concept together for
Jump went through a few processes and a couple other whole concepts. In the end
it was a mesh of two, entwined as one, a bit from there and another from here.

Being the design lead on this project showed me the complexities and how all
my research into restaurant websites paid off. Being able to make smart calls,
specific mobile only design choices and also mandatory pieces for desktop,
allowed for all of the Oliver and Bonacini Restaurant Sites to be as successful
as they are. The process went great, being in charge of content, building,
QA and working with the client on changes/updates was a fun progression.
I believe this website is extremely useful, modern and embodies Jump's modern,
edgy and business class atmosphere. Yay!
