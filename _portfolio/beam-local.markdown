Taking a company which you work for and redesigning their website in it's entirety
+ levelling up it's branding to be more focused and mature is actually easier
than I thought - in this case. I work with Clients of Beam Local everyday, I know
what they like, what they typically want and I know where we wanted to take Beam
Local in means of clientele. To poach such clientele, a slight sophistication of
the current brand was necessary. By simplifying brand elements, colours and fonts
a new Beam Local emerged. The new website has continually improved since the
initial launch of the single page, it now has fresh new blog posts every week and
slight enhancements over time. I am proud to work at Beam Local, especially when
this website is at the foreground representing us and all that we do.
