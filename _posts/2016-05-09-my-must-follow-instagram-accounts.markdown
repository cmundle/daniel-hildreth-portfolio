#### Taylor Burke

Taylor’s sense of adventure and genuine aspiration for life gives me life. I’m always curious to see where he is off to next, the next location, and the next adventure. It has been fun to watch his following grow from 10’s of thousands to 100’s of thousands. Taylor also has a great sense of humour, his SnapChat stories while on the road and in-between photo shoots are not one to be missed. Make sure to follow him on Instagram [@taylormichaelburk](https://www.instagram.com/taylormichaelburk/), on Snapchat: taylorburk1991 and also check out his [personal portfolio](https://www.taylorburk.com).

#### Hello Mr. Magazine

I enjoy a good magazine, and it was hard to narrow down a favourite but I believe that Hello Mr. is a good choice. Providing their readers with an insight into gay culture, fashion, writing and pop culture, Hello Mr. does it beautifully. Their Spotify monthly playlists are always something I look forward to, as well as the reveal for their latest cover. Hello Mr. is one of my favourite sources for culture, they are quick, relevant and fun.

#### Ryan Putnam

“Designer, Illustrator, Father” is his bio and he achieves all that in a magical way. Besides that, Ryan has an incredibly unique style of illustration. His portraits are what I look forward to seeing most, just as much as his landscapes and iconography. Looking at his overall feed, I think it helps that he is using a consistent colour to unify and connect. If his style was not enough to stand out, which I think it does, his colour choices and textures within his illustrations only boost his aesthetic.

#### Worker Bee Supply Co.

Worker Bee Supply Co. is one of my most recent favourite finds. I originally came across one of the founders while working at Chatelaine as I wanted to use one of her photos for the magazine and we’ve been following each other ever since. This new venture of hers, alongside her partner, is a great one! Fair priced prints are hard to come by, especially one-of-a-kind prints from talented artists - these guys are on the right track. Love what they stand for and how they are doing it.

#### Patrick Janelle

Patrick Janelle, otherwise known as “aguynamedpatrick” was the first person I thought of when writing this post. His travel, event, fashion and food photos create a great mix for a perfect feed. His food shots make me want to eat and visit the restaurant (I’ve actually visited a couple of his spots while in LA & SF) his fashion posts make me wish I had his sense of style and his travel shots.. everybody wishes for an escape to an unknown territory. If you don’t already follow him make sure you check him out.
