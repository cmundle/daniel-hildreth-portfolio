This was my first restaurant website after completing a month's worth of research
(on and off) along side the team at Agency Dominion. We collected information about
must-haves, trends, do's and don't's, hierarchy, what customers need, what they
want to see, what is important to them and also, how to showcase all of the above.
It was a fun process, and an important one.

With the Drawing Room, we really wanted to showcase the local art and uniqueness
of their restaurant. To do so content was carded, joining together where needed,
but floating on top of art. The art helps to push the depth and scale of the site,
as well as convey the message of the Drawing Room.
