Taking a company which you work for and redesigning their website in it's entirety,
as well as levelling up it's branding to be more focused and mature, was actually
easier than I thought it would be. After working with the clients of Beam Local
everyday and knowing what they like and what they typically want, we knew where we wanted
to take Beam Local in terms of future clientele. To poach such clientele, it was
necessary to add a bit more sophistication to the current brand. By simplifying
brand elements, colours and fonts, a new Beam Local emerged. The new website has
continually improved since the initial launch of the single page: it now has
fresh new blog posts every week and slight enhancements over time. I am proud to
work at Beam Local, especially when this website is at the foreground representing
our team and all that we do.
