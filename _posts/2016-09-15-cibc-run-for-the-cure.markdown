### [We are all change makers](https://cibcrunforthecure.supportcbcf.com/site/TR/RunfortheCureFY17/RFTC17?px=4119788&pg=personal&fr_id=2551&imt=personal&uuid=390ab62b-3b02-45a4-aae9-f0f4099d53f5&bc=1473964138102)

Iâ€™ll be running in this years CIBC Run for the Cure on October 2 with the rest of the [Mighty Marshian](https://cibcrunforthecure.supportcbcf.com/site/TR/RunfortheCureFY17/RFTC17?team_id=98511&pg=team&fr_id=2551) team. I enjoy participating in this national event because of the people, and learning the stories of survivors, knowing that I am helping fight the disease in my own way and seeing everyone else's energy to make each year bigger and better for Cancer Research. Please help me in reaching my fundraising goal, and the team's goal by making a donation. Thank you in advance for your generosity!
