When we were supplied with the initial brand vision from the O&B Team there was
a lot to accomplish and live up to in a design for the first restaurant to open
in the financial district. "Jump has since continued to define downtown dining.
The food is robust and honest, featuring North American cuisine with an influence
of the beloved New York City." With that teaser in mind, what do you take from it?
Immediately I envision sophistication, business, cocktails, bold energy, with a
rough edgy side.

Bringing a concept together for Jump went through a few processes and a couple
additional concepts. In the end it was a mesh of two ideas, combined in one.
Being the design lead on this project showed me the complexities of the process
and how all my research about restaurant websites paid off. Being able to make
smart calls, specific mobile only design choices and also mandatory pieces for
desktop, allowed for all of the Oliver and Bonacini Restaurant Sites to be as
successful as they are. The process went great: being in charge of content,
building, QA and working with the client on changes/updates was a fun progression.
