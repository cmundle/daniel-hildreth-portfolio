I enjoy working within all mediums of design; from desktop websites to mobile screens,
branding and editorial pieces, plus anything else I believe in. I’m best at
being open minded about all possibilities, paying attention to every point/pixel,
and figuring out direct solutions for all problems that life throws. I enjoy
working with global brands and local businesses on large to small design
projects, and I’m always ready to help out in any way. When I’m not designing and
clicking away the day, you can find me snuggling with my cat or binging on the
latest Netflix Original, or quite possibly both!

If you want to work together or have any additional questions for me, I’d love
to hear from you and to talk all things design.
