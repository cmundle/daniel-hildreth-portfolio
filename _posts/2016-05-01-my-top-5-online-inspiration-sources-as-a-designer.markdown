## What are your daily inspirations? These are mine:

#### the internet can have a big impact on productivity, either by helping it or dragging you down a loop of pointless cat videos, so today I'm going to share with you some of my favourite sources of design inspiration online. I use these websites on a daily basis, quite often throughout my design process and I find them to be really helpful - hopefully you will too.

###### 1. TheInspiration.com

I unfortunately can not remember how I came across this site but I do know I can not go a day without visiting it. This site is normally my #1 in the morning after getting settled in, they post all media types from photography, videos, fashion, architecture, design and advertising. I've found some great sources for inspiration on this site - items that I've shown to everyone even my parents as I thought it was worth sharing. They recently got online ads added to the site which was a bit of a let down and eye sore for me but if there is something worth seeing on the internet I normally see it here first. This site serves as an excellent access point to curated media from around the world.

###### 2. Websites We Love

Second on my list of go to inspirations is Websites We Love, done by Designspiration - this site is amazing for web designers. Featuring sites I would never have come across, would never have imagined and wouldn't have thought could work. This site is a real inspiration source because it truly inspires me to create better websites and to hopefully have work featured on it. Love this site, and I hope you will to!

###### 3. Designspiration.com

If you're a designer or creative person and haven't checked out designspiration yet I would find that rather hard to believe. This site was, I think, the very first site I came across for a source of inspiration. The search works great - I like how you can start typing on load and you're searching - very intuitive. This site really has everything you could be looking for, the related colour palette pieces is also a great function. All in all designspiration is still one of my go to's - be careful you don't get looped in.

###### 4. Instagram

Nothing provides me with a 24/7 source of inspiration like Instagram does. You might think it's just images, or just socially driven - yes it is, but there's also so much more. From magazine covers, photo shoots, unheard of travel destinations, fellow graphic designers, creative brands, recipes, and plenty more. Instagram also allows myself and everyone else with a instant means of creative output.

###### 5. Pinterest.com

This might be the least surprising website on my list, I've not met or talked to a fellow designer who hasn't used it. With that being said I remember when I thought Pinterest was for crafters, moms or foodies. Turns out, I'm a big fan of Pinterest - yes I also use it because I'm a foodie and have been know to do crafting but it has also been one of my biggest influences + sources for design. Pinterest has one of the best functioning searches available, the site is an ease to use and is actually endless. Pinterest has helped me with mood boards, concept photography, planning vacations, DIY projects and in becoming a better designer. It's also just fun and enjoyable to browse in your free time! If you don't already and would like too, feel free to follow me on Pinterest!
