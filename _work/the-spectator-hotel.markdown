I wish, plan and hope for the day that I can stay at The Spectator Hotel. This
website started from a previous landing page of sorts when the hotel was still
in development and being built. It featured artist renderings and a minimum amount
of content. Once the hotel officially opened, I was given the task of designing a
fully functional, photo heavy website for this brand new hotel with the help of
the rest of Agency Dominion by my side. The Hotel owner was also the interior designer
and her main goal was to showcase the level of luxury and simplicity the hotel offers,
all while generating bookings of course!

The Spectator Hotel was recently named #2 Hotel within the World by [Travel & Leasure Magazine.](http://www.travelandleisure.com/worlds-best/hotels-top-100-overall#the-spectator-charleston-south-carolina)
