This was my first restaurant website after completing a months worth of work
on research (on and off). I collected information about must-haves, trends, do's and don't's,
hierarchy, what customers need, what they want to see, what is important to them
and also, how to showcase all of the above. It was a fun process, and an important
one – it set the foundation for all of the O&B work Agency Dominion did, and I
was the go to person for any questions or concerns.

With the Drawing Room, they really wanted to showcase the local art and uniqueness
of their restaurant. To do so content was carded, joining together where needed,
but floating on top of art. The art helps to push the depth and scale of the site,
as well as convey the message of the Drawing Room. The Drawing Room accomplished
a lot off my checklist for "Restaurant Websites”.
